# JPI - JTL-Wawi Programming Interface

This project provides a REST-API for working with the JTL-Wawi Database.

## Please Note:

This is not software by JTL-Software. This REST-Api is built by the community and is therefore not officially supported

# Which version is compatible with my JTL-Wawi?

That's really simple. We build a new Version of JPI for every new version of JTL-Wawi, that has changes in the
database schema. If your JTL-Wawi has version 1.3.11.2, just use version 1.3.11 from JPI.
